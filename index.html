          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>My name is Austin Marino and I am currently
            persuing a Bachalors of Science degree in
            Software Engineering with a Minor in Mathematics.
            My current educational objectives are to expand
            my knowledge of software development and implementation;
            while, continuously adapting to and obtaining the
            necessary knowledge to not only succeed in the academic
             setting but also within the technological Industry.</p>

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <h3>Global Case Competition</h3>
          <h4>Washington State University</h4>
          <h5>October 2017 – November 2017</h5>
          <p>I directed a team of five fellow
            students to develop innovative solutions
            for the complex global crisis of digital
            inequality within Tanzania. For the competition,
            we had to submit a written response and
            proposal of our solution; which, we then
            had to develop into a PowerPoint to be
            presented to a panel of judges and fellow students.
            Through this experience, I gained invaluable
            teamwork experience and discovered solutions
            for Information and communications technology
            inequality within developing nations like Tanzania.</p>
            <h3>Hackathon</h3>
            <h4>Washington State University</h4>
            <h5>Febuary 2017</h5>
            <p>I created a Python program that traversed
              through any size spreadsheet and all of its
              individual cells to read in the entirety of
              the file's data. My program then returned key
              information and values found within the
              spreadsheet so the user wouldn't have to
              calculate the information by hand. Through
              this project, I discovered new programming
              concepts and techniques in order to surmount
              rising challenges that arose during the 24-hour
              competition.</p>

          <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>
          <h4>Washington State University</h4>
          <h5>August 2017 – Present</h5>
          <p>I am currently a Teaching Assistant for
            Computer Science 121, Program Design and
            Development, which is written in C. This
            position requires that I teach a 3-hour
            lab every week to a class of around 20
            students'. Additionally, I hold 2 hours
            of office hours every week for students
            in my lab and others who seek more personal
            help on their assignments and general
            inquiries. Lastly, I am also the sole grader
            for all of my student's work; Which, include
            their exams, quizzes, and programming assignments.</p>
          <h3>Freelance Developer</h3>
          <h4>Washington State University</h4>
          <h5>April 2017</h5>
          <p>Due to my involvement in the Boeing E-Connections
            program, I was given the opportunity to assist a
            startup company that was created by fellow
            WSU students. They were in need of a computer
            science student to collect and parse through
            thousands of lines of data in order to ensure
            the quality and quantity of the information contained.
            To do this, I wrote a program in Python which read
            through the multitude of data sets, and organized
            and combined all the necessary information that
            was needed by the startup.</p>
          <h3>Instructor</h3>
          <h4>Engineering For Kids</h4>
          <h5>May 2015 - November 2015</h5>
          <p>During my time with Engineering for Kids,
            I Instructed students between the ages of 6 and 12 
            about the different aspects of engineering
            as well as how to write simple computer programs.
            To do this I taught my students how to create their
            own video games using simple if, else if and
            else logic along with actual hands-on construction
            of fun and engineering based projects. I was the First
            high school student the company ever hired and was
            promoted from an Intern to an Instructor within only 2 months.</p>
